			\item Noting that the random initialization may sometimes give different results with respect to the best hyper-parameters, in most cases I ran the 5-fold cross validation (for ten epochs each) several times and averaged them to see, on average, which parameters were actually the best. My results were as follows:\\ \\
			\textbf{Simple Perceptron}    \\
			a) rate = \{.01\}  \\
			b) cross-validation accuracy using rate=.01 was \textbf{0.612733}\\
			c) total number of updates on the training set was \textbf{6015}\\
			d) the best accuracy on the development set came with using 16 epochs and yielded an accuracy of \textbf{.735} (see below for the plot used to determine the best epoch to use). This yielded a weight vector, bias combination as follows:\\
			\begin{gather}
				w = [-4.790801  , -6.310801  , 18.629199  ,  0.809199  , -9.290801,\\
				-8.960801  , -3.480801  ,  1.899199  ,  0.75067916, -1.05087573,\\
				0.91483852,  1.0267039 ,  3.30614975,  1.8007971 ,  0.88184558,\\
				0.41990239, -2.7867524 , -0.66128905, -2.170801  ] \\
				b = -4.567802999999947
			\end{gather}
			e) using the weight vector and bias from epoch 16 to predict on the test set, the algorithm reported an accuracy of \textbf{.587065} \\

			\textbf{Decaying Perceptron}    \\
			a) For the specific combination of the random shuffling of the training data and the initial weight vector and bias, I found the optimal initial rate = \{1\}  \\
			b) cross-validation accuracy using rate=1 was \textbf{0.664533}\\
			c) total number of updates on the training set was \textbf{5113}\\
			d) the best accuracy on the development set came with using 17 epochs and yielded an accuracy of \textbf{.71} (see below for the plot used to determine the best epoch to use). This yielded a weight vector, bias combination as follows:\\

			\textbf{Margin Perceptron}    \\
			a) For the specific combination of the random shuffling of the training data and the initial weight vector and bias, I found the optimal combination of hyper-parameters to be margin=.01, rate=1  \\
			b) cross-validation accuracy using margin=.01, rate=1 was \textbf{0.6880}\\
			c) total number of updates on the training set was \textbf{4930}\\
			d) the best accuracy on the development set came with using 14 epochs and yielded an accuracy of \textbf{.6} (see below for the plot used to determine the best epoch to use). This yielded a weight vector, bias combination as follows:\\
