For the Extra Credit implementation, I wasn't sure how to best go about it so I ultimately embedded my design in a tooltip (yes, you heard that right) that appears on hover over the brushed elements list. While it may seem simple enough, it tooks an unhealthy amount of time to code a visualization into a tooltip. On click the visualization pins to the screen for interaction with the brushing of years.
