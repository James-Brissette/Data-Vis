\section{Shattering}
\label{sec:shattering}

[15 points] Suppose we have a set $X_n$ consists of all binary
sequences of a length $n$.  For example, if $n=3$, the set would
consist of the eight elements \texttt{\{000, 001, 010, 011, 100,
  101, 110, 111\}}.

Consider a set of functions $H_n$ that we will call the set of
{\em templates}. Each template is a sequence of length $n$ that is
constructed using {\tt 0}, {\tt 1} or {\tt -} and returns $+1$ for
input binary sequences that match it and $-1$ otherwise. While
checking whether a template matches an input, a {\tt -} can match
both a {\tt 0} and a {\tt 1}.

For example, the template {\tt -10} matches the binary strings
{\tt 010} and {\tt 110}, while {\tt -1-} matches all strings that
have a {\tt 1} in the middle position, namely {\tt 010}, {\tt
  011}, {\tt 110} and {\tt 111}.

Does the set of templates $H_n$ shatter the set $X_n$? Prove your
answer.
